            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a senior data analytics major at Chapman University, graduating in the spring of 2022. The wide applications
            of data and statistics from sports to business models have always been facinating, so being able to learn in the
            data science field is a dream come true. Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing games ands enthusiast hobbies such 
            as building keyboards and computers.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Personal Database</h3>
            <p>I developed and am currently practicing on a SQL database, which is able to perform a 
            variety of functions, including the ability to create, add, delete, and modify new and 
            existing entries. In the future, I plan to extend this to a Discord Bot for game information, 
            so people can use it to call information they may want to see in a quick and easy manner.
            </p>
            <h3>Dungeon Crawler Game</h3>
            <p>I developed a small game as a side project using the c# Unity engine. In it, the player would
            traverse several randomly generated floors, attempting to find the stairs to the next floor, 
            while combating various enemies. Being able to work with the intricacies of game creation and
            design was a very good experience, as it improved my overall design skills, especially in 
            information presentation and user interfaces.
            </p>
            <h3>Website Reader</h3>
            <p>I worked with a team to develop a program which can pull certain types of information from
            an inputted website. I learned how to work with the corresponding python API's to interact with
            website data and architecture.
